# EXERCISE 2 - Mars Rover Programming Exercise

## Description
The Mars Rover Programming Exercise is a simulation designed to emulate the navigation of a Mars Rover across a grid-based terrain. The Rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right while avoiding obstacles and staying within grid boundaries. This project emphasizes the use of pure Object-Oriented Programming principles, design patterns, and avoids conditional constructs to achieve its objectives. The simulation also incorporates advanced design patterns such as Command Pattern and Composite Pattern to ensure flexibility and modularity in the implementation.

## Features
- Initialize Rover with a starting position and direction.
- Execute commands to move forward, turn left, and turn right.
- Detect and avoid obstacles in the grid.
- Optional status report generation for the Roverâ€™s current position and direction.
- Use of Command Pattern to encapsulate commands.
- Use of Composite Pattern to handle grid and obstacles.
- Adherence to OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Installation
To set up and run the Mars Rover simulation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mars-rover-simulation.git
   cd mars-rover-simulation
   
2. **Build the Project**:
